Data Understanding: Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical) and their distributions. 

Data Preprocessing: 

Handle missing values with mean/median/mode.

Treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest from the Sklearn library. Identify skewness in the dataset and treat skewness with appropriate data transformations, such as log transformation 

(which is best suited to transform target variables—train, predict, and then reverse transform it back to original scale, eg:dollars), boxcox transformation, or other techniques, to handle 

high skewness in continuous variables.

EDA: Try visualizing outliers and skewness (before and after treating skewness) using Seaborn’s boxplot, distplot, and violinplot.

Model Building and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets. 

Model GUI: Using streamlit module.
